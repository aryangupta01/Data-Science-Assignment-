This contains only notebook as data files are too big to upload. I have used TFidVectorizer to vectorize the product names and the cosine similarity to find the nearest product in both datasets.

You have to download notebook and then run all the cells. On a specified cell you will asked to enter the name of the product to be searched and then on the next cell you will get the results.

FastText Vectorizer is also used to see if accuracy improves but it decline as the model on which FastText is trained is of wikipedia, if it will be trained on these amazon and flipkart datasts then the accuracy will be improved very much.
